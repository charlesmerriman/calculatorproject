# Snapshots the current database's content tables into the fixture JSON files.
#
# This is a ONE-WAY tool. There is deliberately no loading counterpart: the
# seeding script was deleted because `loaddata` upserts by primary key, and
# production content lives in admin-panel edits that a stale snapshot would
# silently overwrite. Treat these files as a diffable backup and as input for
# the generators in scripts/ — never load them into a database you care about.
#
# Usage: bash dump_fixtures.sh   (run from the backend/ directory)
#
# Output is normalized to match the repo's fixture style — 2-space indent, raw
# UTF-8 (not \uXXXX escapes), trailing newline — so diffs show only real data
# changes rather than reformatting. Review `git diff` before committing.
