"""
Attaches the missing featured umas to the JP launch banner (2021-02-24).

The launch banner exists in production as a bare BannerTimeline row: it has a
name listing nine units, but no BannerUma, no BannerSupport and no image. Since
the featured-card links are what put a unit into the selector pool, the nine
BASE launch units are currently unreachable there — only their costume variants
(Special Week (Summer), Tokai Teio (Anime), ...) can be picked. An uma selector
ticket cannot select base Special Week, Tokai Teio, Oguri Cap and so on at all.

This is a LINKING job, not a creation job. All nine Uma records already exist;
they are simply not attached to any banner. The command creates one BannerUma
against the launch timeline and links the nine through UmasOnUmaBanner.

Two deliberate choices:

  - The timeline is found by its JP start date, not by primary key. The row is
    present in production and absent from local databases, so its id is not
    portable.

  - The unit list is parsed from the timeline's own `name`, which is the sheet's
    " + "-joined concatenation. Hardcoding nine names here would let this drift
    from the row it repairs.

Support cards were originally skipped here, on the grounds that the source
Google Sheet's Timeline tab does not reach back to 2021-02-24 so the launch
banner's support side was unknowable. That was the wrong place to look:
timeline_master.csv — the file the backfill pipeline already reads, tracked in
git and deployed alongside the app — carries all twenty of them for this row.
They are linked here now.

Idempotent, and the two halves are independent: whichever of the uma and
support banners is missing gets created, the other is reported and left alone.
That matters because the uma half was applied to production before the support
half existed, so the second run must complete the row rather than see a uma
banner and exit.

Usage:
    python manage.py repair_launch_banner --dry-run   # report only
    python manage.py repair_launch_banner             # prompts
    python manage.py repair_launch_banner --no-input  # scripted

Run against PRODUCTION from the DigitalOcean API component's Console tab, and
--dry-run there first — local databases do not contain this row.
