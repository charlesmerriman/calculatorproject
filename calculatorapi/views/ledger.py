class IncomeLedgerRowSerializer(serializers.Serializer):
    """
    Wire format for one `calculatorapi.ledger` row.

    A plain Serializer over dicts rather than a ModelSerializer: ledger rows are
    derived facts assembled across three models, not instances of any one of
    them. Declaring the shape explicitly is also what makes the contract with
    `frontend/src/types/ledger.ts` reviewable in one place.

    `date` is the instant the reward lands. `throughout_end` is the end of the
    curve a `carats_throughout` pool decays over (null on rows that carry none);
    the buffer between an event's end and its banner's end is already removed —
    see calculatorapi/ledger.py.

    The amount columns are always present and always integers, on every row and
    every kind, so the client never guards on shape. Race rows carry zeros: what
    a placement pays depends on the user's rank, which only the client knows.
    `LedgerSerializerTests` pins this field list against `ledger.AMOUNT_FIELDS`.
