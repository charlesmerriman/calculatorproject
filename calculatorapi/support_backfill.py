"""
Shared pieces for the commands that attach missing support cards to banners.

Two commands need the same three things — read the pipeline's master CSV, turn
a " + "-joined name list into SupportCard rows, and refuse rather than guess
when a name doesn't resolve. They live here so the two cannot drift apart.

MATCHING MIRRORS THE FIXTURE PIPELINE. `scripts/build_missing_banners.py`
already solves this problem when it generates fixtures, and if the two
disagreed the same CSV row would produce different links depending on which
path built it. So `normalize` and `ALIASES` are deliberate copies of that
script's. **Change them together.** They are copied rather than imported
because `scripts/` is a standalone tool tree, not an importable package inside
the deployed app.

The COLLISION RULE has deliberately diverged — see the next paragraph. The
script now prefers SSR the same way, but the date tiers live only here, because
only this side is the one that writes to a real database.

WHY NAMES ALONE ARE AMBIGUOUS: SupportCard.name is not unique, by design — see
the model's own note that "many characters have 2-3 support cards sharing the
exact same name (different rarities/reprints)". Production holds four rows
named exactly "Grass Wonder". `game_id` is the real identity, and the CSV
carries only names, so a collision has to be resolved by rule.

THE OLD RULE WAS LOWEST game_id, AND IT WAS WRONG. game_id encodes rarity —
1xxxx is R, 2xxxx SR, 3xxxx SSR — so "lowest" picked the R variant every single
time a character had one. That is never right: gacha banners feature SSRs, and
an R card is not obtainable from a banner at all. It put 20 R cards on the JP
launch banner in production (see the `fix_support_card_variants` command, which
repairs the damage this rule caused).

THE RULE NOW: among same-named SSR rows, pick by date against the banner's own
JP start, in two tiers borrowed from `scripts/fix_banner_support_links.py`:

  Tier 1 (debut) — exactly one variant whose source release_ja IS the banner's
  JP start date. The card launched on this banner.

  Tier 2 (rerun) — no debut match, so among variants released on or before that
  date (a banner cannot feature a card that does not exist yet), take the most
  recent, but only if it leads the runner-up by MIN_RERUN_MARGIN_DAYS. A tighter
  gap means two cards launched close together and there is no honest way to say
  which one a later banner is reusing.

Anything neither tier settles is reported as unresolved, never guessed at. The
fallbacks are narrow and each has a reason: one candidate needs no rule; no SSR
row at all falls back to the old lowest-id behaviour (a name whose rows predate
the game_id backfill still has to resolve to something); and no release date
for any candidate falls back to the lowest SSR, which is at least always a
card a banner could actually feature.

ONE GUARD SITS AHEAD OF ALL OF IT. If the source says a card debuted on this
banner's date and that game_id is not in the database, everything below is
refused. Otherwise tier 2 happily supplies the character's most recent older
reprint, which is indistinguishable from a correct answer in the output and
wrong in the database. Every 2026 banner in this project's local database hits
that case, because the cards are newer than the local snapshot.

WHY NOT FUZZY MATCHING: a similarity check offered "Hishi Miracle" as the
second-best match for "K.S. Miracle". Those are different cards. Normalization
plus an explicit alias table is as far as this goes; an unresolved name is
reported, never guessed at.
