"""
Writes calculatorapi/data/changelog.yaml into the ChangelogEntry table.

The changelog is the one piece of site content that describes the code, so it
lives in the repo beside it rather than only in the database: an entry is
written in the same pull request as the work it announces, gets reviewed with
it, and ships when it ships. This command is what closes that loop.

Production runs it on every deploy, in the service's run_command next to
`migrate` (see backend/.do/app.yaml). There is no other route to the production
database — the app's database is an App Platform *dev* database with no external
endpoint — so a deploy is how a changelog entry reaches the live site.

Usage:
    python manage.py sync_changelog --dry-run     # report, write nothing
    python manage.py sync_changelog               # write
    python manage.py sync_changelog --strict      # exit 1 if the file is bad

What it touches, and what it does not:

    Entries are matched on ChangelogEntry.key. The file OWNS an entry whose key
    it lists: title, version, date and the whole list of change lines are
    replaced with what is written here, so an admin edit to a managed entry
    survives only until the next deploy.

    Entries with no key were written by hand in the admin. They are never read,
    written or deleted here. Dropping an entry from the file likewise does not
    delete it — it only stops being managed, because a deploy silently deleting
    published content is a worse failure than a stale line.

IT EXITS 0 ON A BAD FILE unless --strict is passed. This runs on the path that
starts the web service: a typo in a patch note must not be able to keep the API
from booting. Problems are reported on stdout and NOTHING is written when the
file does not validate — read the deploy log rather than trusting the exit
status. --strict inverts that for local checks and the test suite, where a
non-zero exit is the entire point.
