    Packs and selectors are one tagged model rather than two, because they are
    structurally the same thing — a priced item, attached to a campaign, bought
    in some quantity, crediting paid carats. The only difference is that
    selectors additionally grant a ticket, which `product_type` records. This
    codebase already narrows on tag fields elsewhere (see `event_type` on the
    timeline union), so the frontend pattern is established.

    Real-money prices live in the database, never in code, so they can be
    corrected without a deploy when the store changes.
