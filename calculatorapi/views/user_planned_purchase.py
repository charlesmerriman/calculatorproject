        Cutoffs are reference data that legitimately moves. Most campaigns
        carried no cutoff at all until 0034 backfilled one, and null reads as
        UNRESTRICTED -- so their pickers offered every card ever released, and
        users saved picks that were perfectly legal at the time. Editors are
        expected to keep correcting these in the admin as real dates surface.

        Re-checking an untouched row would therefore reject a plan the user
        never changed. And because the client saves the whole plan in one atomic
        PATCH, that rejection is not confined to the offending pick: it 400s the
        entire request, so a single stale selector target locks the account out
        of saving its stats and banners too, with no way back except deleting
        the pick.

        Grandfathering the stored pairing keeps the backstop pointed at what it
        was written for -- a stale client persisting a NEW ineligible pick --
        while never letting a shared-data correction brick an individual's
        plan. Product is part of the identity on purpose: moving the same target
        onto a different campaign is a different pairing, and gets re-checked
        against that campaign's cutoff.
